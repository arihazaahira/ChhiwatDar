  "ingredients": [
    "450g of lukewarm water",
    "250g of fine or extra fine durum wheat semolina",
    "8g of fresh baker's yeast (or one 5g sachet of dry yeast)",
    "2g of baking powder",
    "3g of fine salt",
    "Honey and melted butter for serving"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Put all the ingredients (water, semolina, yeasts, salt) in a blender and blend for 4 minutes until you get a smooth and homogeneous batter.",
    "Pour the batter into a bowl, cover it, and let it rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour (it should foam on the surface).",
    "Heat a non-stick pan or crepe maker (without greasing it).",
    "Pour a small amount of batter (about 1/2 ladle) in the center of the hot pan.",
    "Cook without flipping. The 'thousand holes' should appear on the surface, and the top should dry while the bottom just starts to brown (about 30 seconds to 3 minutes per crepe).",
    "Place the crepes on a clean towel. Do not stack them until they are completely cooled.",
    "Serve warm, drizzled with a mixture of honey and melted butter."

  "name": "ghriba bahla",
  "ingredients": [
    "450 g of flour",
    "125 g of soft butter",
    "150 ml of oil",
    "100 g of powdered sugar (or 250 g of granulated sugar)",
    "1 packet of baking powder (or 2 packets)",
    "1 tsp of ground cinnamon",
    "A pinch of salt",
    "Half a glass of sesame seeds (optional) (or ½ bowl of powdered sesame)",
    "Anise (unspecified quantity) (optional)",
    "3 cloves (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "In a large bowl or the bowl of a mixer, mix all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and sesame (if used).",
    "Add the soft butter and rub the mixture with your fingertips.",
    "Gradually add the oil and gather the dough without kneading it too much, just enough to form a homogeneous ball. The dough should remain soft.",
    "Preheat the oven (temperature not specified, but often around 180°C).",
    "Form small balls of dough the size of a hazelnut or a large walnut (depending on preference).",
    "Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, without flattening them.",
    "To achieve the cracked effect, first place the baking sheet at the top of the oven (or turn on only the top heating element) so that the tops of the ghribas crack, then place the sheet at the bottom to finish baking and lightly brown the bottoms (about 20 minutes in total, monitor closely)."

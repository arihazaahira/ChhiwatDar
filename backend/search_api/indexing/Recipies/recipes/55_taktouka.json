  "name": "taktouka",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 red bell peppers (or green/mixed)",
    "6 tomatoes",
    "1 red onion (optional, finely sliced)",
    "3 garlic cloves (finely minced)",
    "20 g chopped coriander (or parsley/coriander)",
    "1 tsp cumin",
    "1 tsp paprika",
    "Olive oil",
    "Lemon juice",
    "Salt, pepper, sugar (a pinch for the tomatoes)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 220°C (or use a grill/barbecue). Cut the bell peppers into quarters and remove the seeds/membranes. Bake the peppers (with a bit of olive oil) for 40 minutes until they are grilled.",
    "Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes into quarters. In a pan, pour olive oil with cumin and paprika. Add the garlic, onion, and tomatoes with the sugar. Cook for 10 minutes so the tomatoes caramelize slightly.",
    "Remove the peppers from the oven. Let them rest in an airtight container (to make peeling easier). Remove the skin and finely slice the peppers.",
    "Mix the caramelized tomatoes with the sliced peppers. Add salt, pepper, coriander, and a bit of freshly squeezed lemon juice.",
    "Serve warm or cold as a salad/appetizer."
